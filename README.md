# CineSync - Organize Your Media Library Easily

CineSync is a comprehensive media library management system designed to efficiently organize libraries for Movies & TV shows, eliminating the need for Sonarr/Radarr.

While highly optimized for debrid platforms, CineSync is also versatile and works effectively with non-debrid platforms.

# How CineSync Works ?

CineSync creates symbolic links from source directories to destination directories, organizing them according to your preferences and metadata from TMDb/IMDb/TVDB. This approach allows you to maintain a well-structured library without physically moving or duplicating files, preserving disk space while enabling advanced organization features.
